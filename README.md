# Arduino-Musical-Instrument
We built a musical instrument based on Arduino. The device has three PMods - A keypad, a speaker, and a lcd screen. There are sixteen push buttons on the keypad in a 4 by 4 way. The upper 8 push buttons control the volume of the output sound, while the lower 8 push buttons control the pitch of the output sound. Whenever a button is pressed, the Arduino will detect which number the button is, then change the volume/pitch of the sound from the speaker. Also, there is a 2*16 PCF8574 LCD display near the speaker then can display the current volume and pitch, and it can change simultaneously after a button is pressed.
